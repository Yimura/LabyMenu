# LabyMenu

This is a very bare bones mod menu for Labyrinthine, all it does is allow you to play with more than 4 players (currently hard coded to 16).

There's a bunch of unnecessary extra code in the code base and honestly I'm not too happy with everything in this code base however after having laid dormant doing nothing on my drive I decided to make the source code public.

I've reversed and made a few il2cpp structures so I can interact with them appropriately.
